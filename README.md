## Problem Statement
1. Create a class with get and set function.
2. Create a function in a class to check if the user is valid or not.
3. If the user is valid in get method show a message “The username “ argument” is
a valid user .
4. If the user is not value display a error message “The user is not valid”
5. Create getset.html, add compiled file into this HTML like(getset.js). The output
should display the valid and invalid string.
6. DO remember to annotate with proper datatype the parameters and function

## Solution
Since in point 5 it is mentioned to display both Valid as well as invalid messaged in output, I have called the method 2 times during the loading. If the user is adult it shows the message in header section elese in footer section

## Output
1. Screenshot_output.png - captured the running output in browser
